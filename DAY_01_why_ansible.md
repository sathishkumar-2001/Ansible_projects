DAY - 1 : 

why ansible -> 
 10 years before there was role called system admins who is responsible for configuration management
 it takes more time for doing the configuration in the servers 
 so ansible makes this easier in any distribution 

some of the other tools for configuration management -> puppet , chef , salt
some of the problems in (puppet , chef) is complex structure and not agentless ( we need to install some software in the target machines)

ansible uses -> infrastruce as code , configuration management , ci/cd used in deployment phase , network automation
ansible does the deployment in the target hosts parllelly

installing ansible - python must be installed in controll node and managed nodes
based on distribution it varies like apt install Ansible
